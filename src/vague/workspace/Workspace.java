        /* 'WORKSPACE' BUFFER EXPLANATION
        All child children except for one currently being moved are drawn because this Workspace's own
          buffer is then drawn to the 'workspace' buffer, which is a buffer of all Modules not being 
          moved / resized. Doing it like this cuts down on the amount of graphical operations greatly
          because instead of drawing all children to both buffers, all static children can be drawn to the Module
          buffer and then that buffer can be drawn to the 'workspace' buffer, containing all the static
          children but not the dynamic child. The dynamaic child is then drawn onto this buffer because it
          needs to, just like every other child.
