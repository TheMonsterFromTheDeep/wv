                  the dismiss button. Therefore, if the mouse is located here, the module becomes dismissable (ACTION_CLOSE).
                - The areas between the corners, when clicked, allow the user to drag the WorkTool around. Therefore,
                  if the mouse is in one of these areas, the next action becomes ACTION_MOVE, and once the mouse is
                  clicked, 'action' itself will become ACTION_MOVE.

                  the WorkTool to fill itself with a new SmartMenu so a new control can be selected.
                - If the mouse is in any of the corners other than the close button, the WorkTool can be resized. In the future,
                  the close / refresh buttons may be moved over and a new resize button located where the close button currently
